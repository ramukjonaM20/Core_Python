The programs provided here are carefully crafted to introduce key concepts progressively, making it easier for learners to grasp the fundamentals of Python programming.

## Getting Started with Google Colab

Google Colab is a free, cloud-based environment that allows you to write and execute Python code within interactive notebooks. To get started with Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Google Account**: Make sure you have a Google account. If not, create one.
2. **Access Google Colab**: Open your web browser and navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. **Create a New Notebook**: Click on "New Notebook" to create a new Colab notebook.
4. **Coding Environment**: Colab provides a coding environment where you can write and execute Python code cells.
5. **Save to Google Drive**: You can save your Colab notebooks to your Google Drive for easy access and collaboration.
